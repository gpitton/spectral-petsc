Experiments with matrix-free Chebyshev collocation for nonlinear elliptic/Stokes
problems with fully iterative solutions.

You will need FFTW and a recent PETSc to build.

The numerical method is spectral collocation on the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto
nodes.  Derivatives are applied by DCT using FFTW.  For preconditioning, a low
order method (finite difference or finite element) on the collocation nodes is
used to produce a sparse matrix which captures the spectral properties of the
high order (dense, thus not actually formed) matrix.  If a strong preconditioner
(for instance -pc_type lu or -pc_type hypre) is used on this sparse matrix, the
number of required iterations is nearly independent of polynomial order.  Thus,
for a 3D problem with polynomial order P in each cartesion direction, there are
P^3 nodes and O(P^3 log P) operations required when using multigrid
preconditioning.  This is optimal for a spectral method.
